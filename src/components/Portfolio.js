 The Letters that never came .

This isn’t really a story about a boy or his letters.
You’ll understand what it’s really about once we reach the end — but for now, let’s begin where all stories of love and loss should: with a boy and his father.

Chapter 1 
For My Champion

London, 1930s. He was ten. Small. Bullied for his height. But it didn’t matter much.
Because every evening, just after the sun dipped behind the chimney tops, the front door would creak open — and there he was. His father.
Never empty-handed.
Some days it was a peppermint toffee wrapped in brown paper. Other days, a miniature wooden boat, carved roughly from leftover firewood. Once, it was just a feather — but he’d spun a tale of a great hawk that dropped it on his way to the clouds.
Whatever it was, it always came with the same warmth: a hand on the boy’s head, a tired smile, and that familiar voice saying, “For my champion.”
And just like that, the ache from school, the names, the bruises on his confidence — all of it melted.
It was like standing in the cold too long and someone suddenly wrapping you in a thick, old coat.
Or like being lost in a tunnel, and seeing one small light ahead — enough to keep walking.
Maybe that’s why the boy never told anyone how much he was hurting. His father brought magic home every day. That was enough. For a while.
As the bullying dragged on, the boy couldn’t take it anymore.
It felt like three rough wolves chasing down a vulnerable  kitten.
One afternoon, he almost told his father. The words were there — on the tip of his tongue. But they never came out.
Something inside him overflowed.
“Why am I so weak?” he thought. “What would Father think of me?”
His father, a man who’d built himself from the ground up. A soldier. Strong. Unshaken.
The boy smiled that evening like nothing was wrong, even though his heart felt shattered.
It was a silent scream for help, but his body — and worse, his mind — refused to let it out.
Telling the truth felt like failure.
And so, the boy made a choice:
If no one could fight the wolves for him, he’d fight them himself.
But how does a kitten take on wolves?
Even if he clawed at one, the others would tear him apart.
Still… he tried.
And failed.
Because kittens, no matter how brave, don’t survive a pack of wolves.
They didn’t just push him down.
They broke him.
His bones. His spirit. His will to speak.
They dragged him into the bathroom, soaked him with toilet water, laughed while his limbs trembled beneath him.
They weren’t wolves anymore.
They were something darker.
Demons, maybe — but not born that way. Just forged in their own private hells.
The boy never saw it coming, but their rage wasn’t truly for him.
He was just the outlet.
Their anger was a hand-me-down — passed on from fathers who shouted too loud and mothers who never hugged back.
When his father found out, he nearly lost himself.
He wanted to hurt them. To crush their little monstrous hands with his own.
They were punished. Suspended. Names were written in red ink on school files.
But that night, as the boy lay curled on the couch with his leg in a cast and a silence too big for the room…
His father sat beside him.
And for the first time, he had nothing in his hands.
No toy. No sweet. No story.
Just his hand — trembling — on the boy’s shoulder.
Because sometimes, there’s nothing you can bring home to make things okay....

    fullText: `Have you ever felt alone even when you're surrounded by people who love you?

You’re in a room full of familiar faces, but you feel disconnected. Like you're silently screaming for help, and no one hears you. Or maybe you're just... mute.

That’s when it hits you:

Hell and heaven don’t exist somewhere else.
They exist here, inside your head.

This is my story,
Of the time I was drowning, and not even the world’s best swimmer could save me.

I’ve always been emotionally messy. Relationships? Let’s just say I couldn’t even have a normal one with my father. He yelled. I shouted back. The cycle continued.

But oddly, that wasn’t my hell.

Not even close.

I’ve always been an introvert  someone who enjoyed being in his own world. I liked it, actually. I never felt truly alone in solitude.

But life changes.

You grow.

You meet new people.

You’re forced into new environments.

You can’t do everything by yourself anymore. You need others emotionally, mentally.

Like water, you’re expected to take the shape of whatever container life throws you into.

For someone like me, that’s exhausting.

Still, I told myself: “At least I won’t be alone anymore… right?”

Wrong.
There’s a difference between being alone and being truly alone.

I realized this at a party.

Great food. Loud music. Drinks flowing. Everyone chatting. Laughing. Living.

And me?

Standing there.

Hearing nothing but silence inside.

Not even my own thoughts.

It felt like I was being swallowed by a void.

That… was true loneliness.

Final Note:

If you've ever felt that way  like you're screaming underwater and no one can hear you — you're not crazy.

You're human.

And sometimes, the loudest cries are the ones no one else hears.

fullText: `I’ve met a lot of people in my life — but I was never emotionally dependent on anyone.

Until her.

She was small. 4'11" — though she’d insist she was 5'1". I’m 6'1". From the moment I saw her at the office, something stood out. It wasn’t love at first sight. It was just... something.

I don’t open up easily. I’ve always kept things to myself. But with her, for reasons I still don’t fully understand, I started talking. About everything. She made me feel safe, heard, and understood.
We fell into this rhythm. I’d talk about life, and she’d listen — really listen. She’d guide me, offer perspective, and calm my overthinking. She was older. Grounded. Experienced. And I started depending on her — maybe more than I should have. Maybe that’s when the cracks started.

At work, I’d joke around just to get her attention. Playful irritation became a habit. But now, as I prepare to leave that job and join a new company in August, it’s not the role I’m mourning. It’s her. Or the loss of what we had.

I didn’t want to lose the one person who made me feel emotionally safe. So I held on too tight. Smothered it. Pushed too hard. And in the end — I was the one who broke it.

Like someone who builds a house brick by brick... and then bulldozes it down before it’s even finished.

If I could go back, I’d do things differently. I wouldn’t be that needy, attention-seeking version of myself. I’d just be... me. The version she liked.

Looking back at our conversations, I realize how intense I became. Five months of deep emotional dependency? That would scare anyone. I dug a hole so deep that now neither of us can climb out of it.
I wish I could’ve been the ladder instead. But I wasn’t strong enough — not yet.

If I ever send this to her, it’s not to fix anything. It’s not a plea. It’s just my truth. My closure.

Because if I came back now, I’d fall into old patterns again — seek comfort, lean on her too much, and start digging that hole all over again. I can’t risk that. Not for me. Not for her.

So I’ll try to grow. To heal. To become better. For the next person who comes into my life — or maybe just for myself.

Maybe I’m not that hard to be around after all.

She tried to pull me into the light, but it was too much. A 4’11” soul can’t carry someone else’s full emotional weight. That was never fair of me to expect.

This doesn’t feel like an ending.

It feels like a turning point.

This is the last time I think about this.

Now, I build. From the ground up.

From the unsure, self-doubting guy with bad posture and too many thoughts — to someone whole.
Will I get there?

I don’t know.

But I’m done digging.`,
